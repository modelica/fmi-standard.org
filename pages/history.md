## Modelisar

[MODELISAR](https://itea3.org/project/modelisar.html) was an ![ITEA2](https://svn.fmi-standard.org/fmi/branches/public/img/itea2.png) European project to improve significantly the design of systems and of embedded software in vehicles.
MODELISAR had 29 partners and started in July 2008 and finished, after extension, in December 2011.

**Major achievements**

A new and open interface standard FMI (Functional Mock-up Interface) was developed to conveniently exchange models from different simulation environments, including the Modelica and non-Modelica tools of the MODELISAR partners.
Usage of a model in another environment can either be performed by model coupling, i.e., no integrators are embedded in the model, or by co-simulation in various levels.

**MODELISAR partners**

ARMINES, AIT, ATB, AVL List, Altran, Daimler, Dassault Systèmes, Dassault Systèmes AB, David, DLR, FhG (First, IIS,
EAS, SCAI), Geensoft, Halle University, IFP Energies nouvelles, LMS Imagine, INSPIRE, SIMPACK, ITI, LMS International,
QTronic, Trialog, Triphase, TWT, Verhaert, Volkswagen, Volvo

## Modelica Association Project

To continue the cooperation of the FMI development partners beyond MODELISAR, the core development partners decided to find a new home for their activities under the roof of the [Modelica Association](https://www.modelica.org/).
According to the Bylaws of the Modelica Association, a new [Modelica Association Project](https://modelica.org/projects) _Functional Mock-up Interface_ was created.

**Purpose**

Development, standardization and promoting the Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) definition, one result of the ITEA2 project MODELISAR. The intention is that dynamic system models of different software systems can be used together for software/model/hardware-in-the-loop simulation, for cyber physical systems, and other applications.
