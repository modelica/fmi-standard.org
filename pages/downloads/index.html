        <p class="contentbox-content">
            This is the second version of the Functional Mockup Interface standard (FMI). It is a major enhancement
            compared to FMI 1.0, where the
            FMI 1.0 Model Exchange and Co-Simulation standards have been merged, and many improvements have been
            incorporated, often due to
            practical experience when using the FMI 1.0 standards. New features include: Parameters can be changed
            during simulation, the complete
            FMU state can be saved, restored and serialized, directional derivatives with respect to states and inputs
            can be computed, the
            structure of the partial derivatives with respect to states and inputs can be given (to support large
            systems), algebraic loops over FMUs
            are now supported in all modes (initialization, event, continuous-time) for Model Exchange, allowing for
            example improved initialization.
