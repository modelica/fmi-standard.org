        <p class="contentbox-content">
            <p>This is the second version of the Functional Mockup Interface standard (FMI). It is a major enhancement compared
                to FMI 1.0, where the FMI 1.0 Model Exchange and Co-Simulation standards have been merged, and many improvements
                have been incorporated, often due to practical experience when using the FMI 1.0 standards. New features
                include: Parameters can be changed during simulation, the complete FMU state can be saved, restored and serialized,
                directional derivatives with respect to states and inputs can be computed, the structure of the partial derivatives
                with respect to states and inputs can be given (to support large systems), algebraic loops over FMUs are
                now supported in all modes (initialization, event, continuous-time) for Model Exchange, allowing for example
                improved initialization.</p>

                <p>The intention is that a modelling environment can generate C-Code of a dynamic system model that can be utilized
                    by other modelling and simulation environments. Models are described by differential, algebraic and discrete
                    equations with time-, state- and step-events. The models to be treated by this interface can be large
                    for usage in offline or online simulation or can be used in embedded control systems on micro-processors.
                    It is possible to utilize several instances of a model and to connect models hierarchically together.
                    A model is independent of the target simulator because it does not use a simulator specific header file
                    as in other approaches. A model is distributed in one zip-file called FMU (Functional Mock-up Unit).</p>

            <p class="contentbox-content">
                <p>The intention is to provide an interface standard for coupling two or more simulation tools in a co-simulation
                    environment. The data exchange between subsystems is restricted to discrete communication points. In
                    the time between two communication points, the subsystems are solved independently from each other by
                    their individual solver. Master algorithms control the data exchange between subsystems and the synchronization
                    of all slave simulation solvers (slaves). All information about the slaves, which is relevant for the
                    communication in the co-simulation environment is provided in a slave specific XML-file. In particular,
                    this includes a set of capability flags to characterize the ability of the slave to support advanced
                    master algorithms, e.g. the usage of variable communication step sizes, higher order signal extrapolation,
                    or others.</p>

            <p>The FMU Compliance Checker is a free software provided by the Modelica Association, implemented by Modelon AB
                to check a given compliance of an FMU with the FMI standard. The FMU Compliance Checker relies on the FMI
                Library for loading and interacting with FMUs. A wide and increasing range of problems are checked for and
                reported to the user. This is an excellent tool for developers creating FMUs or creating FMU export functionality
                in their tool. Download the <a href="https://trac.fmi-standard.org/browser/branches/public/Test_FMUs/Compliance-Checker">FMU Compliance Checker 2.0</a>.

            <p>The FMU SDK is a free software development kit provided by QTronic to demonstrate basic use of Functional Mock-up
                Units (FMUs) as defined by the FMI Specification version 2.0 (July 25, 2014) and 1.0. The FMU SDK can also
                serve as starting point for developing applications that export or import FMUs. The FMU SDK contains the
                C sources for various discrete and continuous FMU models, a batch file for compiling and zipping these models,
                an XML parser for parsing the model description of an FMU and a simple simulation program that runs a given
                FMU and outputs the result as CSV file. The FMU SDK 2.0.3 for Windows 32 and 64 bit (provided by QTronic):

        <p class="contentbox-content">
            <p>FMI Library (FMIL), provided by Modelon, is a software package written in C that enables integration of Functional
                Mock-up Units (FMUs) import in applications. FMI Library is an independent open-source (BSD) implementation
                of the FMI open standard. The library provides a comprehensive C API for interacting with all parts of FMUs,
                including unzipping, loading of shared object files (DLLs) contained in FMUs, as well as parsing of XML model
                metadata files. FMI Library provides a proven and complete platform for developing FMI enabled applications
                and gives access to the technology used in several industrial FMI tools including the FMI Compliance Checker.
                FMIL support FMI for Model Exchange 1.0, FMI For Co-simulation 1.0 and FMI 2.0. For more information, visit:
