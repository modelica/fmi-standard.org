    <article class="contentbox">
        <h3 class="title title-two contentbox-title">ASAM XIL-MA</h3>
        <p class="contentbox-content">
            <p>At the beginning of the ITEA2 project MODELISAR (the project in which FMI was initially developed) it was planned
                to develop FMI for Applications. The intention was to specify an API for simulation tools that allows the
                access of model parameters, stimulations and simulation results and to control simulation experiments as
                well. The API was supposed to provide tool independent access to simulation computations for optimization
                tools, test management and workflow definition tools.</p>

            <p>The project group noticed the parallel work of the ASAM XIL standardization group. Thus, both groups came to
                the conclusion not to develop a parallel standard but to cooperate. The result of this cooperation is available
                as ASAM XIL-MA, which is a subset from ASAM XIL standard. It contains the model access port specification
                as well as necessary common functionality for a proper operation of the model access. XIL-MA is open to public
                and the documentation of the standard can be obtained from ASAM for free without membership.</p>

        <p class="contentbox-content">
            <p>In many applications there is the need to design, simulate and execute a network of components (simulation models,
                software, hardware etc.). In order to be able to do this tool independently and seamlessly, the purposes
                of the “System Structure and Parameterization of Components for Virtual System Design (SSP)” project are:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Define a standardized way to store and apply parameters to these components.</li>
                <li>Define a standardized format for the connection structure for a network of components.</li>
                <li>The developed standard / APIs should be usable in all stages of development process (architecture definition,
                    integration, simulation, test in MiL, SiL, HiL).</li>
            </ul>

        <p class="contentbox-content">
            <p>One of the topics of the Smart Systems Engineering project is to find solutions for the cross-disciplinary and
                cross-enterprise exchange of behavioral models. The Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) is viewed as the basic
                technology for the exchange.</p>
