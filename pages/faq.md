# General questions about FMI

## When will FMI 3.0 be released?

 The FMI Steering Committee has decided not to publish a release date.
 New versions will be released according to the [FMI Development Process](https://svn.fmi-standard.org/fmi/branches/public/docs/DevProcess/FMI_DevelopmentProcess_1.0.pdf) as soon as the quality gates are fulfilled.
 Currently four FMI Working Groups are working on new FMI features (see below).
 The Progress of the development can be tracked on [GitHub](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-standard).


## What will be the new features of FMI 3.0?

The FMI Steering Committee is happy to announce the preliminary (Alpha) feature list for FMI 3.0.
"Preliminary" means that we might be forced to drop some features from that list for the actual release.
This list is based on the results of the respective working groups which were discussed at the FMI Design Meeting Nov 2017 and updated by the FMI Steering Committee decisions in Apr 2019 (extending Intermediate Output Values to Intermediate Variable Access) and Oct 2019 (adding extra directory)

- Ports and Icons:  
  Help the user to build consistent systems from FMUs and render the systems more intuitively with better representation of structured ports (for instance busses and physical connectors) in the modelDescription.xml.

- Array variables:  
  Allow FMUs to communicate multi-dimensional variables and change their sizes using structural parameters.

- Clocks and Hybrid Co-Simulation:  
  Introduces clocks for synchronization of variables changes across FMUs. Allows co-simulation with events.

- Binary Data Type:  
  Adds an opaque binary data type to FMU variables to allow, for instance, efficiently exchanging of complex sensor data.

- Intermediate Variable Access:  
  Allow access to intermediate input and output values between communication time points from the FMU to disclose relevant subsystem behavior for analysis or advanced co-simulation master algorithms for enhanced numerical stability.

- Source code FMUs:  
  Adding more information to the modelDescription.xml file to improve automatic import of source code FMUs.
  
- Numeric Variable Types: 
Adds 8, 16, 32 and 64-bit signed and unsigned integer and single precision floating point variable types to improve efficiency and type safety when importing / exporting models from the embedded, control and automotive domains.

- Extra directory: 
Adding a new folder in the ZIP Archive representing an FMU, providing addtional data to travel with the FMU which can be modified by different tools, allowing for layered standards

In the unlikely event of unsolvable conflicts between features, the FMI Steering Committee might be forced to again remove or alter features during the merge-phase of all FCPs starting after the release of the Beta feature list. The FMI Steering Committee will make these FCPs available to interested parties on request once their maturity allows dissemination.


## What are the license and usage conditions for the FMI standard?

Access and use of the FMI standard is free of charge. However, vendors may charge for their tools to support the FMI standard, either by exporting FMUs or by importing FMUs.

**To be clear: While the FMI standard is open and free, commercial implementations might not be.**


## How can I join the FMI mailing lists?

- The “FMI-Info-Mailing list” is used for public announcements. You can find a registration link on our contact page.
- The “FMI design” Mailing list is used by active developers of FMI (typically members of the FMI Advisory or Steering Committee). If you are interested please contact contact@fmi-standard.org
- The “FMI Steering” Mailing list is used by members of the FMI Steering Committee. To join you need to be a member of the FMI Steering Committee.


## How is FMI related to Modelica?

- Technically FMI is not related to Modelica, and can be seen as a complementary technology.
- The intention of the FMI project is to be neutral with respect to tools, technologies (e.g. solvers, OS, files, systems…) and languages (including Modelica).
- The FMI standard is developed as a Modelica Association Project within the Modelica Association, an organization focused on the “coordinated standardization and development of software technology and methods in the area of cyber physical- systems and systems engineering”, see the Modelica Association Bylaws and the History page


# I'm a modeler and want to use FMI in my simulation tool

## How can I get a first overview on FMI?

Please have a look at the literature page, especially on the overview talks/slides from the 8th, 9th and 10th Modelica Conference

- FMI 1.0: “The Functional Mock-up Interface for Tool independent Exchange of Simulation Models” PDF
- FMI 2.0: “Functional Mock-up Interface 2.0: The Standard for Tool independent Exchange of Simulation Models” PDF
- FMI 2.0: Presentations about new features and applications ZIP


## Does my simulation tool support FMI?

Please see the FMI tools page for a list of tools for that tool vendors have announced their support of FMI.

**While the FMI project defines cross check rules, the tool vendors carry sole responsibility for their stated FMI support and the provided compatibility results.**


## Where can I get help when I have problems related to FMI in my simulation tool?

- Typically an exporting and an importing tool are involved in FMI-based simulation. So if problems occur and if it is not obvious which tool causes the problem, you should communicate the problem to the support team of both involved tools
- As a general discussion forum about FMI, you may use the FMI forum on Stack Overflow


## Is there a tool vendor independent way to access model information during simulation?

ASAM XIL-MA is a standardized API that allows the access of model parameters, stimulations and simulation results and to control simulation experiments as well. Please see the related ASAM XIL-MA section.


# I'm a developer and want to support FMI with my tool

## What and in which order should I read/do to get started with FMI technology?

That depends mostly on your background knowledge. We assume here you already have fundamental knowledge of simulation technology (ODE vs. DAE, zero-crossing, state/time events, derivatives etc.):

- First make a quick pass trough the standard document.
- Then browse and play with the available 3rd party development toolkits.
- Read the implementation hints contained in FMI_for_ModelExchange_v1.0.zip - not yet available for FMI 2.0.
- Re-read the standard document in detail.


## Does FMI 2.0 support Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)?

There are two kinds of FMI variants: Model Exchange and Co-Simulation.

Model-Exchange FMUs encode ODEs. PDE-support is not planned yet, but the demand for it is increasing.

The second kind, Co-Simulation FMUs, can contain any kind of simulation component because it does not expose states. So as long as you want to simply encapsulate PDEs, this could be done.

But explicitly exposing a PDE to a solver using FMUs is currently not supported.


## I added my test FMUs/Cross-Check results but the tools page does not show "green". Why?

The Cross-Check Rules list a number of conditions before turning an entry “green”. In short:

- Exporting tools must provide at least 3 FMUs and at least one importer must report successful import.
- Importing tools must report (and prove) successful import of at least 3 FMUs of at least 3 exporting tools.

Please refer to the [FMI Cross-Check Rules](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-cross-check/blob/master/FMI-CROSS-CHECK-RULES.md).
