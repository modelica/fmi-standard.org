    <p>
        Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) is a tool independent standard to
        support both model exchange and co-simulation of dynamic models
        using a combination of xml-files and compiled C-code (see overview in
        <a href="https://svn.modelica.org/fmi/branches/public/docs/Modelica2011/The_Functional_Mockup_Interface.pdf" target="_blank">PDF</a>
        or <a href="https://svn.modelica.org/fmi/branches/public/docs/Modelica2011/The_Functional_Mockup_Interface.ppt" target="_blank">PPT</a> format).
    </p>
    <p>
        The first version, <a href="http://fmi-standard.org/downloads#version1" target="_blank">FMI 1.0</a>,
        was published in 2010, followed by <a href="/downloads" target="_blank">FMI
        2.0</a>
        in July 2014. The FMI development was initiated by Daimler AG with
        the goal to improve the exchange of simulation models between suppliers
        and OEMs (see <a href="http://fmi-standard.org/history/">History</a>).
        As of today, development of the standard continues
        through the participation of <a href="/development">16
        companies and research institutes</a> under the roof of the <a href="https://www.modelica.org/">Modelica Association</a>
        as a <a href="https://modelica.org/projects">Modelica Association Project</a>.
        FMI is supported by <a href="/tools">over 100 tools</a> and is
        used by automotive and non-automotive
        organizations throughout Europe, Asia and North America.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the <a href="/downloads">Downloads</a> page, the official
        standard texts are provided, as
        well as supporting C-header and xml schema files, and an FMI compliance
        checker. In addition, sample models (exported from different
        tools in FMI format) are provided to assist tool vendors to ensure compatibility
        with other tools.
