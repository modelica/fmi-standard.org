<h2>FMI Version 2.0</h2>
<h3>FMI for Model Exchange and Co-Simulation</h3>
<p>This is the second version of the Functional Mockup Interface standard (FMI). It is a major enhancement compared
        to FMI 1.0, where the FMI 1.0 Model Exchange and Co-Simulation standards have been merged, and many improvements
        have been incorporated, often due to practical experience when using the FMI 1.0 standards. New features
        include: Parameters can be changed during simulation, the complete FMU state can be saved, restored and serialized,
        directional derivatives with respect to states and inputs can be computed, the structure of the partial derivatives
        with respect to states and inputs can be given (to support large systems), algebraic loops over FMUs are
        now supported in all modes (initialization, event, continuous-time) for Model Exchange, allowing for example
        improved initialization.

        <h3>FMI for Model Exchange</h3>
            <p>The intention is that a modelling environment can generate C-Code of a dynamic system model that can be utilized
                by other modelling and simulation environments. Models are described by differential, algebraic and discrete
                equations with time-, state- and step-events. The models to be treated by this interface can be large
                for usage in offline or online simulation or can be used in embedded control systems on micro-processors.
                It is possible to utilize several instances of a model and to connect models hierarchically together.
                A model is independent of the target simulator because it does not use a simulator specific header file
                as in other approaches. A model is distributed in one zip-file called FMU (Functional Mock-up Unit).</p>

        <h3>FMI for Co-Simulation</h3>
        <p>
            <p>The intention is to provide an interface standard for coupling two or more simulation tools in a co-simulation
                environment. The data exchange between subsystems is restricted to discrete communication points. In
                the time between two communication points, the subsystems are solved independently from each other by
                their individual solver. Master algorithms control the data exchange between subsystems and the synchronization
                of all slave simulation solvers (slaves). All information about the slaves, which is relevant for the
                communication in the co-simulation environment is provided in a slave specific XML-file. In particular,
                this includes a set of capability flags to characterize the ability of the slave to support advanced
                master algorithms, e.g. the usage of variable communication step sizes, higher order signal extrapolation,
                or others.</p>
