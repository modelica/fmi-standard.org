<h2>FMI Version 2.0</h2>
<h3>FMI for Model Exchange and Co-Simulation</h3>
<p>This is the second version of the Functional Mockup Interface standard (FMI). It is a major enhancement compared
        to FMI 1.0, where the FMI 1.0 Model Exchange and Co-Simulation standards have been merged, and many improvements
        have been incorporated, often due to practical experience when using the FMI 1.0 standards. New features
        include: Parameters can be changed during simulation, the complete FMU state can be saved, restored and serialized,
        directional derivatives with respect to states and inputs can be computed, the structure of the partial derivatives
        with respect to states and inputs can be given (to support large systems), algebraic loops over FMUs are
        now supported in all modes (initialization, event, continuous-time) for Model Exchange, allowing for example
        improved initialization.

        <h3>FMI for Model Exchange</h3>
            <p>The intention is that a modelling environment can generate C-Code of a dynamic system model that can be utilized
                by other modelling and simulation environments. Models are described by differential, algebraic and discrete
                equations with time-, state- and step-events. The models to be treated by this interface can be large
                for usage in offline or online simulation or can be used in embedded control systems on micro-processors.
                It is possible to utilize several instances of a model and to connect models hierarchically together.
                A model is independent of the target simulator because it does not use a simulator specific header file
                as in other approaches. A model is distributed in one zip-file called FMU (Functional Mock-up Unit).</p>

        <h3>FMI for Co-Simulation</h3>
        <p>
            <p>The intention is to provide an interface standard for coupling two or more simulation tools in a co-simulation
                environment. The data exchange between subsystems is restricted to discrete communication points. In
                the time between two communication points, the subsystems are solved independently from each other by
                their individual solver. Master algorithms control the data exchange between subsystems and the synchronization
                of all slave simulation solvers (slaves). All information about the slaves, which is relevant for the
                communication in the co-simulation environment is provided in a slave specific XML-file. In particular,
                this includes a set of capability flags to characterize the ability of the slave to support advanced
                master algorithms, e.g. the usage of variable communication step sizes, higher order signal extrapolation,
                or others.</p>

<h3>FMI and FMU Logos (and Banner)</h3>
<p>New FMI and FMU logos are now available for <a href="https://svn.fmi-standard.org/fmi/branches/public/FMI_Logos.zip">download</a>.
   The banner of the FMI home page is also part of the zip file now.
   Note: By downloading the logos you agree to abide by these <a href="https://svn.fmi-standard.org/fmi/branches/public/FMILogo-License_v5.pdf">Terms and Conditions</a>.
</p>

<h3>FMU Compliance Checker</h3>
<p>The FMU Compliance Checker is a free software provided by the Modelica Association, implemented by Modelon AB
    to check a given compliance of an FMU with the FMI standard. The FMU Compliance Checker relies on the FMI
    Library for loading and interacting with FMUs. A wide and increasing range of problems are checked for and
    reported to the user. This is an excellent tool for developers creating FMUs or creating FMU export functionality
    in their tool. Download the <a href="https://github.com/modelica-tools/FMUComplianceChecker/releases">FMU Compliance Checker 2.0</a>.
    Sources are now stored on <a href="https://github.com/modelica-tools/FMUComplianceChecker">GitHub</a>. Note
    that this version supports both FMI 1.0 and 2.0 specifications.</p>

<h3>CSV Compare</h3>
<p>
    CSV Compare, provided by the Modelica Association, is a C# implementation
    of CSV file comparator and syntax checker (with limited diagnostics).
    The sources and pre-compiled binaries are available on
    <a href="https://github.com/modelica-tools/csv-compare">GitHub</a>.
</p>

<h2>Tools and resources provided by 3rd parties</h2>
<h3>Please note</h3>
<p>The FMI project is not responsible for the correct functionality or FMI standard compliancy of the listed 3rd
    party tools.</p>

<h3>Test FMUs</h3>
<p>To allow testing of import functionality, a growing number of Test FMUs is provided from different tool vendors
    that export FMUs from their tools. Download these <a href="https://svn.modelica.org/fmi/branches/public/Test_FMUs/">Test FMUs</a>.</p>

<h3>FMU Software Development Kit for version 2.0</h3>
<p>The FMU SDK is a free software development kit provided by QTronic to demonstrate basic use of Functional Mock-up
    Units (FMUs) as defined by the FMI Specification version 2.0 (July 25, 2014) and 1.0. The FMU SDK can also
    serve as starting point for developing applications that export or import FMUs. The FMU SDK contains the
    C sources for various discrete and continuous FMU models, a batch file for compiling and zipping these models,
    an XML parser for parsing the model description of an FMU and a simple simulation program that runs a given
    FMU and outputs the result as CSV file. The FMU SDK 2.0.3 for Windows 32 and 64 bit (provided by QTronic):
    <a href="http://www.qtronic.de/doc/fmusdk.zip">fmusdk.zip</a>. The FMU SDK 1.0.2 for Linux or Mac OS X (adapted
    from Linux version by Christopher Brooks): <a href="http://github.com/cxbrooks/fmusdk2">cxbrooks/fmusdk</a>.</p>

<h3>FMI Library</h3>
<p>FMI Library (FMIL), provided by Modelon, is a software package written in C that enables integration of Functional
    Mock-up Units (FMUs) import in applications. FMI Library is an independent open-source (BSD) implementation
    of the FMI open standard. The library provides a comprehensive C API for interacting with all parts of FMUs,
    including unzipping, loading of shared object files (DLLs) contained in FMUs, as well as parsing of XML model
    metadata files. FMI Library provides a proven and complete platform for developing FMI enabled applications
    and gives access to the technology used in several industrial FMI tools including the FMI Compliance Checker.
    FMIL support FMI for Model Exchange 1.0, FMI For Co-simulation 1.0 and FMI 2.0. For more information, visit:
