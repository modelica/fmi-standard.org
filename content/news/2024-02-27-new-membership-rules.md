Project members are divided into three groups with a hierarchy of duties and rights:  

- **Steering Committee Members** are a subset of 
- **Contributing Members** which are a subset of 
- **Advisory Commitee Members**.

The FMI Advisory Committee will be strengthened to get more input and feedback from the industry.
The membership is now possible after approval by the FMI Steering Committee without signing the Contributors' License Agreement (CLA).
