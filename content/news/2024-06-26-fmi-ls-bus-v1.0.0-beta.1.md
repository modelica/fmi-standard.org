The Modelica Asscociation Project FMI is happy to announce the pre-release v1.0.0-beta.1 of the Layered Standard for Network Communication FMI-LS-BUS.

It has been successfully tested and cross-checked with prototypes from several tool vendors and is approved by the FMI Steering Committee.
[This pre-release](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-bus/releases/tag/v1.0.0-beta.1) contains support for CAN, CAN FD and CAN XL only.
In [future releases](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-bus?tab=readme-ov-file#roadmap) it is planned to add support for Flexray, Ethernet, and LIN.
