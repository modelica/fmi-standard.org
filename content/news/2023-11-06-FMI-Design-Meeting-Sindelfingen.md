FMI developers from Akkodis, AVL, Bosch, Dassault Systems, ESI, ETAS, dSPACE, EKS-INTEC, PMSF, Synopsys and Wolfram MathCore participated. Thanks to Akkodis for the great hospitality!     

We focused on layered standards to FMI 3.0: 

* [LS-XCP](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-xcp) for XCP support (v1.0RC2 in preparation)    
* [LS-BUS](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-bus) for network communication (v1.0alpha in preparation)   
* [LS-STRUCT](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-ls-struct) for maps and structuring of variables (concept work)    
* and new ideas for layered standards reference source models, reference solutions, parameters sets.    

Additionally we discussed possible efficiency optimizations for data transfer and access that can be addressed in FMI 3.1.
