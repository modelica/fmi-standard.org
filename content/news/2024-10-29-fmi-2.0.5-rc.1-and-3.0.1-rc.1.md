# Release Candidates for FMI 2.0.5 and 3.0.2 are ready for review

The first release candidates for the maintenance releases [FMI 2.0.5](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-standard/releases/tag/v2.0.5-rc.1) and [FMI 3.0.2](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-standard/releases/tag/v3.0.2-rc.1) are ready for final review.

According to the procedure for the release of maintenance releases of MA standards, a 4-week inspection period starts and will last until November 26.
In the last week of the inspection period, only editorial or typographic changes are allowed.
In case of findings, please open an issue on https://github.com/modelica/fmi-standard.
If there are no blockers detected, the FMI Project will release FMI 2.0.5 and FMI 3.0.2 afterwards.
