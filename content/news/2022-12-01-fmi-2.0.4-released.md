After approval by the FMI Steering Committee on November 10th 2022 and the Modelica Association members on Nov 30th 2022, [FMI 2.0.4](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-standard/releases/tag/v2.0.4) has been released.

This is a maintenance release for FMI 2.0 with [bug fixes and clarifications](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-standard/blob/support/v2.0.x/CHANGELOG.md).

Additionally, two FMI 3.0 features that are "orthogonal" to existing FMI 2.0.x feature and that do not change the functional behaviour or API of an FMU, have been backported 

-	Terminals and Icons https://fmi-standard.org/docs/3.0/#fmiTerminalsAndIcons
- 	Build Configuration https://fmi-standard.org/docs/3.0/#BuildConfiguration


FMUs created according to the FMI 2.0.4 specification are valid FMI 2.0 FMUs and vice versa.
