#  Pre-Release of FMI Layered Standard for Network Communication (FMI-LS-BUS) v1.3.0-alpha.1 with LIN support available

The FMI Project is happy to announce we have just published the 1.3.0-alpha.1 version of the FMI-LS-BUS standard, that version that finally adds the long-awaited LIN support. 
This version includes the common Physical Signal Abstraction, that fits for all bus types, and the Network Abstraction that currently supports CAN, CAN FD, CAN XL (from v1.0.0), FlexRay (from v1.1.0; currently in Beta state), Ethernet (from v1.2.0; currently in Alpha state) and LIN. 
Check out our roadmap to get more information about the expansion plans of the FMI-LS-BUS.
