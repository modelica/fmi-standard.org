The Modelica Conference 2019 will take place March 4-6 2019 in Regensburg organized by OTH Regensburg / 
Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology, in cooperation with the Modelica Association, 
see [here](https://modelica.org/events/modelica2019/index_html).
 
The FMI user meeting will take place within the “industrial user presentations” session of the different Modelica Association 
Projects on the first day of the MODELICA Conference 2019 as a complement to the scientific track(s) on FMI within the 
conference. The intent is to increase the interaction between FMI users in different companies / institutions and the 
Modelica Association Project FMI.
 
FMI users will give presentations showing how FMI is used for model interchange between different companies or different 
departments resp. engineering domains within one company, enabling collaborative model-based systems engineering. Users can 
also give feedback on their experience with FMI and missing features for the future. Additionally, the connection of FMI to 
past and future research projects will be summarized.
