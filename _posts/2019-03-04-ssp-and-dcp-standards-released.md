At the Modelica Conference 2019, two new standards complementing the FMI standard have been released:

[System Structure and Parameterization (**SSP**)](https://ssp-standard.org/) is a tool independent standard to define a complete system consisting of one or more FMUs including their parameterization that can be transferred between simulation tools.

[Distributed Co-Simulation Protocol (**DCP**)](https://dcp-standard.org/) is a platform and communication medium independent standard for the integration of models or real-time systems into simulation environments.

FMI, SSP and DCP are compatible standards and their development is synchronized acoording to the goals of the Modelica Association.
