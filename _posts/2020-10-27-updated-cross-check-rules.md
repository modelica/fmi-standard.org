The FMI Steering Committee has passed [an updated version 4.1 on the FMI Cross-Check Rules](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-cross-check/blob/master/FMI-CROSS-CHECK-RULES.md), which includes the following changes:

* The FMI Steering Committee revised its decision to introduce fees for listing in the FMI Cross-Check tables: there will be no listing fees for Cross-Check results.

* The FMI Steering Committee decided to reduce the required proof for import results to the self-assessment passed/failed files.
This will help reduce the space requirements for the Cross-Check repository without practically reducing the quality of the results.
Existing result files for importers will be removed by the project factotum without further notice.
