The [Modelica Conference 2021](https://https://2021.international.conference.modelica.org/) will take place from Sept 20-24, 2021 as a virtual and free event.

The FMI user meeting will take place on Sept 23 as an "industrial user presentations" session. The intent is to increase the interaction between FMI users in different companies / institutions and the Modelica Association Project FMI.

FMI users will present how the standard is used for the exchange of models between different companies or
departments, enabling collaborative model based systems engineering.
Users can also give feedback on their experience with FMI and missing features for the future.
More information is contained in the [call for participation](https://2021.international.conference.modelica.org/fmi-user-meeting.html).
Submissions are accepted until June 15 2021.
