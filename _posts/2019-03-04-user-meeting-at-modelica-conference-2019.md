The [Modelica Conference 2019](https://2019.international.conference.modelica.org/) will take place from March 4-6, 2019 in Regensburg, Germany organized by the OTH Regensburg /
Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Information Technology in cooperation with the Modelica Association.

The FMI user meeting will take place during the "industrial user presentations" session of the different Modelica Association
Projects on the first day of the Modelica Conference 2019 as a complement to the scientific tracks on FMI within the
conference. The intent is to increase the interaction between FMI users in different companies / institutions and the
Modelica Association Project FMI.

FMI users will present how the standard is used for the exchange of models between different companies or
departments, enabling collaborative model based systems engineering.
Users can also give feedback on their experience with FMI and missing features for the future. Additionally, the connection of FMI to past and future research projects will be summarized.
More information is contained in the [call for participation](https://svn.fmi-standard.org/fmi/branches/public/docs/Modelica2019/CFP_FMI-User-Meeting_Modelica_Conference_2019.pdf).
