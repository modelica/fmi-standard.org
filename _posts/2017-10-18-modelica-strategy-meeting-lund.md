On October 17th, 2017, the Modelica Association (MA) Board and other
MA members discussed the future direction of MA and its projects
on a MA strategy meeting: The MA will slightly restructure internally
in the coming 6 months to
allow MA Projects more autonomy while centrally strengthening
open, coordinated standards and software, their
quality, stability and interoperability.
