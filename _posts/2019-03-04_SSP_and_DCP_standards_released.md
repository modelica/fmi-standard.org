At the Modelica Conference 2019, two new standards complementing the FMI standard have been released: 

System Structure and Parameterization (**SSP**) is a tool independent standard to define complete systems consisting of one or more FMUs  including its parameterization that can be transferred between simulation tools. 
For more information and download see [here](https://ssp-standard.org/).

Distributed Co-Simulation Protocol (**DCP**) is a platform and communication medium independent standard for the integration of models or real-time systems into simulation environments.
For more information and download see [here](https://dcp-standard.org/).

FMI, SSP and DCP are compatible standards, and their development is synchronized acoording to the goals of the Modelica Association.
