# New FMI Project Leader and Deputy

On May 5, 2022 the FMI Steering Committee has unanimously elected Christian Bertsch, BOSCH, as the new project leader and Torsten Sommer, Dassault Syst√®mes, as the new deputy.

The FMI Steering Committee wants to thank the outgoing project leader Andreas Junghanns, Synopsys, and deputy Torsten Blochwitz, ESI Group, for their longstanding leadership of the FMI Project and great merits to the development of the FMI standard - from the beginning until the recent release of FMI 3.0!
