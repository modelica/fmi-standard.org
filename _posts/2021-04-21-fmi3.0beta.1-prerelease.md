The FMI Steering Committee has decided to enter the beta phase of the FMI 3.0 development.
This reflects the stabilization of the FMI 3.0 API and schema files in the alpha phase.
Tool vendors are encouraged to start or intensify prototyping of FMI 3.0 support now.
The FMI 3.0-beta.1 pre-release is available on [github.com/modelica/fmi-standard/releases](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-standard/releases).
