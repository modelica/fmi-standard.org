After approval by the FMI Steering Committee on December 15th and the Modelica Association members on December 23rd, version 2.0.2 of the FMI Specification [has been released](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-standard/releases/tag/v2.0.2) .

This is a maintenance release for FMI 2.0 with bug fixes and clarifications to [9 issues issues](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-standard/blob/support/v2.0.x/CHANGELOG.md).
Aditionally the /extra directory is introduced (already there in SSP, and to come in FMI3.0). This is not a functional change, but clarifies where to store additional files in an FMU, e.g., for layered standards.

FMUs created according to the FMI 2.0.2 specification are valid FMI 2.0 FMUs and vice versa.
