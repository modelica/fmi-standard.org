We're happy to announce that the FMI 2.0 specification has been converted to [AsciiDoc](http://asciidoc.org/) and moved to [github.com/fmi-standard](https://github.com/modelica/fmi-standard).
The development version of the FMI specification can be viewed [directly on the FMI website](/docs/2.0.1-develop/) and will be regularly updated.

It's a major step towards a more agile workflow that leverages the GitHub infrastructure, simplifies contributions and reviews and will accelerate the development of both FMI 2.0.1 and FMI 3.0.
