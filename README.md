## Tools list

The [tools page](https://fmi-standard.org/tools/) is generated from [_data/tools.csv](_data/tools.csv). To add, edit or remove a tool from the table update the respective line and push your changes.

## News

To create a post, add a file to the `_posts` directory with the following format:

```
YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP
```

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file.
For example, the following are examples of valid post filenames:

```
2018-05-22-fmi-forum-japan.md
2018-09-04-modelica-conference-2019.md
```

You typically write posts in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) (`.md`), however HTML (`.html`) is also supported.  
All blog post files must begin with a front matter that sets the title:

```markdown
